Install Docker Engine
*********************

You need the latest Docker version installed. If you do not have it, please see the following installation guide to get it.

#. Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

   .. code:: bash

     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

#. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

   .. code:: bash

     sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
     curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

#. Use the following command to set up the repository:

   .. code:: bash

     echo \
      "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
      $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

#. Update the apt package index:

   .. code:: bash

     sudo apt update

#. Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose.

   .. code:: bash

     sudo apt-get install \
      docker-ce docker-ce-cli \
      containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

#. Manage Docker as a non-root user

   .. code:: bash

    sudo groupadd docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    newgrp docker

Install Git Version Control
***************************

The WAI SDG Portal uses git as version control. Therefore it is better to install git to make it easier to retrieve updates instead download the repository zip.

.. code:: bash

 sudo apt install git

Auth0 Identity Providers
************************

This application **DO NOT** store directly any personal information. WAI SDG Portal uses `AUTH0`_ for a flexible solution to add authentication services.

Please visit `AUTH0`_, then follow below guide:

.. _AUTH0: https://auth0.com/

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   auth0


Mailjet Service
***************

You need to have `MAILJET`_ account to manage the notification deliverability.

.. _MAILJET: https://mailjet.com/

   .. note::
      - ``WEBDOMAIN`` field must be populated with your domain name. In the case of a production environment, kindly ensure to include "https://" prior to your domain name
      - Kindly note that if you are installing to your localhost, it is necessary to add 'http://' before 'localhost' in the WEBDOMAIN variable
      - Before proceeding with the application or installation process, it is crucial to confirm that your domain has been properly pointed to your public IP address
      - Use **Domain** and **Client ID** field from your **Auth0 SPA application** for ``AUTH_SPA_DOMAIN`` and ``AUTH_SPA_CLIENT_ID``
      - Use **Domain**, **Secret** and **Client ID** field from your **Auth0 Backend application** for ``AUTH_DOMAIN``, ``AUTH_SECRET`` and ``AUTH_CLIENT_ID``.
